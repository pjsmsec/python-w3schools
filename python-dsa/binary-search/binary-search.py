# Binary search

# It's a search algorithm that searches through a sorted array and returns the 
# index of the value it searches for

# Steps:
# 1 - Check the value in the center of the array.
# 2 - If the target value is lower, search the left half of the array. If the target 
#       value is higher, search the right half.
# 3 - Continue step 1 and 2 for the new reduced part of the array until the target 
#       value is found or until the search area is empty.
# 4 - If the value is found, return the target value index. If the target value is 
#       not found, return -1.

        if arr[mid] < targetVal:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return -1
