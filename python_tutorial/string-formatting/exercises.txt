What placeholders are used when dealing with f-strings?

    {}

Use the price variable and f-string syntax to display the price with two decimals:
    price = 59
    txt = f"The price is {price:.f} dollars"
    print(txt)

Use an if statement inside the f-string placeholders to return 'perfect' if the 
price is 100, and 'ok' if the price is not 100:
    price = 100
    txt = f"It is {'perfect' if price == 100 else 'ok'}
    print(txt)

Consider the following code:
    price = 1000
    txt = f'The price is {price:,} dollars'
    print(txt)
What will be the printed result?

    The price is 1,000 dollars
