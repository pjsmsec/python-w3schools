What is a correct keyword for defining functions in Python?
    def

Create a function named my_function.
    def my_function:
        print("Hello from a function")

Execute a function named my_function.
    def my_function():
        print("Hello from a function")

    my_function()

Inside a function with two parameters, print the first parameter.
    def my_function(fname. lname):
        print(fname)

Let the function return the x parameter + 5.
    def my_function(x):
        return x + 5

If you do not know the number of arguments that will be passed into your function,
there is a prefix you can add in the funcion definition, which is?
    def my_function(*kids):
        print("The youngest child is " + kids[2])

If you do not know the number of keyword arguments that will be passed into your 
function, there is a prefix you can add in the function definition, which prefix?
    def my_function(**kid):
        print("His last name is " + kid["lname"])
