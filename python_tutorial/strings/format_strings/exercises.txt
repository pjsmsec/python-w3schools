If x = 9, what is a correct syntax to print ?The price is 9.00 dollars'?

    print(f'The price is {x:.2f} dollars')

Insert the correct syntax to add a placeholder for the age parameter.

    age = 36
    txt = f"My name is John, and I am {age}"
    print(txt)

What will be the result of the following code:
    print(f'The price is {2 + 3} dollars')

    The price is 5 dollars
